# how to contribute
At Vegam.App, we follow a collaborative approach to improve our open-source codebase. We use a method called "fork and pull," where contributors maintain their own version of the code, known as a fork. This fork can easily be synchronized with the main codebase. To suggest changes or improvements, contributors create a pull request, proposing to merge their modifications into the main repository.

Contributions come in various forms, including new features, modifications to existing features, tests, documentation (developer guides, user guides, examples, or specifications), bug fixes, optimizations, or valuable suggestions.

Our Community Engineering Team carefully reviews all contributions from the community. During the review, we may ask contributors for clarifications. We strive to close tickets within 14 days; however, if there is no response within this timeframe, please get back to us info@vegam.app.
